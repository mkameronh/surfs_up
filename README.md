# Surfs Up Challenge

## Overview:
The purpose of this analysis was to look at historical weather data in order to see trends in precipitation and temperature. We did so by looking at data from different stations and by comparing data between June and December to see if the ice cream and surf shop idea is sustainable year-round.

## Results:

June:

December:

The three key differences in the June and December data are:
- The mean temp of June is roughly 3 degrees higher than that of December
- There are almost 200 more observations in the month of June than there are in December
- The biggest differnce in the data is between the 'Min' values for June and December with a difference of 8 degrees

## Summary
Looking at the data we can see that there is not a big enough difference between the two in regards to temperature to say that this is not sustainable year-round. The average temps are only apart by 3 degrees and the STDEV is only different by .5, so the temperatures do not vary much from June to December. If we wanted to get a better idea, the two additional queries I did were to look at the percipitation in June and December. This could show us if one month is wetter than the other and could keep customers from wanting Ice cream and to surf.

June:

Above are the Precipitation results of both June and December. By looking at this we can see that there is much more precipitation for December than there is June. The max amount observed has a difference of 2 inches - which is a lot in terms of precipitation. There is not a lot of rain in general, but December (.217) has an amount almost double that of June (.136). I personally do not think this is enought to reasonably say that the store is not sustainable year-round but the precipitation level gives us the extra info we did not get by just looking at the temperature observations.
